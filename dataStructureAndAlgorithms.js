// Built-in data structures do not require the creation of a data structure from scratch. They are already present in JavaScript
// 1) Array
// 2) Set 
// 3) Map

// Data structures like Stack or Queue can be created on our own using other basic data structures. For example, Stacks can be created using Arrays. These are known as User-defined data structures.

// There are many data structure and algorithms. Some of the very good resources on dsa are already present in Internet, so I will share the link of them below.
